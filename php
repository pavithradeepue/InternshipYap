PHP
So basically it is a powerful tool that'll help us in making web pages.
It has similar tags like HTML document - html,body,h1 n all with an extra <php></php> tag inside which we write the php code.
Php in its first look felt like a mix of Java(Object Oriented) and She'll script programming (script style and stytax).
