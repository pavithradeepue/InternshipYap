### ðŸ“š What I Learned

#### ðŸ”¹ Basics of PHP
- PHP is a powerful tool for building dynamic web pages.
- It uses similar tags as an HTML document like `<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, etc.
- The PHP code is written inside special `<?php ... ?>` tags.
- For returning datatype we use `var_dump`.
- Variables are case sensitive.
- String to upper and lower case function `strtoupper()` & `strtolower()`
- The usual if,else,elseif,switch.
- In loops we have foreach with syntax `foreach ($colors as $x)` along with other loops like for,while,do-while.
- 

  
#### ðŸ”¹ My First Impression
- PHP felt like a blend of **Java** (because of its object-oriented features) and **Shell scripting** (due to its scripting style and syntax).
