### ðŸ“š What I Learned

#### ðŸ”¹ Basics of PHP
- PHP is a powerful tool for building dynamic web pages.
- It uses similar tags as an HTML document like `<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, etc.
- The PHP code is written inside special `<?php ... ?>` tags.
  
#### ðŸ”¹ My First Impression
- PHP felt like a blend of **Java** (because of its object-oriented features) and **Shell scripting** (due to its scripting style and syntax).
