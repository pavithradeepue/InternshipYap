# Week 2: Small Wins, Big Servers, and CR7 Magic ✨ 09/06/25

So going to office on a Monday was obviously the *least* thing lazy me could do — but guess what? I did it today.  
And the cherry on top? I saw **RONALDO lift the UEFA Nations League** at midnight.  
Honestly, that’s more than enough motivation to roll out of bed and face the day 💪⚽

## 💻 Developer Diaries

### ❌ Errors I Ran Into:
- In my enthusiastic DBMS phase (powered by sheer will and caffeine), I installed **both SQL Server *and* MySQL Server** on my system.
- Result? **XAMPP’s MySQL won't start** because it's getting into a fight with the other server — yes, the "chota" server refuses to be that chota anymore 😅
- The issue is on my *currently solving* list — thanks to my personal support crew:
  - 🙌 **Stack Overflow**
  - 🤖 **ChatGPT** (of courseee)

## 🔧 Fix In Progress:
> Working on resolving port conflicts and server overlaps.  
> Lesson learned: Don't let your DBMS obsession clutter your ports 😭

Till then, I’ll keep debugging — one port at a time!
